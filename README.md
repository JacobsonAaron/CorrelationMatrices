# CorrelationMatrices

This repository is intended to provide tools for analyzing the manifolds which underly timeseries data, especially via analysis of correlation matrices. More detail will be added to this README soon; I (Aaron) am still in the process of packaging this code for distribution, and I am also actively developing more methods to include here.
